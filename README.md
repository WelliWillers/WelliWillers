### ðŸ”µ Hi guys, I'm Wellington! ðŸ‘‹

First I will introduce myself. My name is Wellington Willers I'm 22 years old and I work in the junior developer business in a small company in the region where I live, a while ago I studied architecture but programming is the area that fills my heart, since then I've been studying ReactJs and NextJs to one day enter this job market.

In the repositories below you will see many of my studies, individual and many projects developed during Ignite, offered by Rocketseat company.
